        <h1>Disadvantages of AI</h1>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKbsGJ_Gw0hgickkqYYHcU0xRHlpCzk1hD9w&usqp=CAU" alt="">
        <h2>1.High cost of implementation</h2>
        <p>Setting up AI-based machines, computers, etc. entails huge costs given the complexity of engineering that goes into building one. Further, the astronomical expense doesn’t stop there as repair and maintenance also run into thousands of dollars. Do you know how much it cost Apple to acquire its virtual assistant SIRI? The acquisition of the software cost somewhere around a whopping $200 million. Further, the high cost of AI implementation is evident from the fact that Amazon acquired Alexa for $26 million in 2013.These AI-based software programs require frequent upgrades in order to cater to the requirements of the changing environment as the machine needs to become smarter by the day. In case the software suffers a severe breakdown, then the process of recovering lost codes and reinstalling the system can give you nightmares due to the huge time and cost involved. </p>
        <h2>2.Can not replace humans</h2>
        <p>It is beyond any doubt that machines perform much more efficiently as compared to a human being. But even then it is practically impossible to replace humans with AIs, at least in the near future, because you can’t build human intelligence in a machine as it is a gift of nature. So, no matter how smart a machine can become, it can never replace a human.We might get terrified at the idea of being replaced by machines, but honestly, it is still a far-fetched notion. Machines are rational but don’t have any emotions or moral values. They lack the ability to bond with human beings which is a critical attribute needed to manage a team of humans.

            Yes, it is true that they can store a lot of data but the procedure of retrieving information from them is quite a cumbersome process, which is way difficult compared to human intelligence. </p>
        <h2>3.Doesn't improve with experince</h2>
        <p>One of the most amazing characteristics of human cognitive power is its ability to develop with age and experience. However, the same can’t be said about AIs as they are machines that can’t improve with experience, rather it starts to wear and tear with time.

            You need to understand one thing that machines can’t alter their responses to changing environments. That is the basic premise on which AIs are built – repetitive nature of work where the input doesn’t change. So, whenever there is some change in the input, the AIs need to be re-assessed, re-trained and re-build.
            
            Machines can’t judge what is right or what is wrong because they are incapable of understanding the concept of ethical or legal. They are programmed for certain situations and as such can’t take decisions in cases where they encounter an unfamiliar (not programmed for) situation.</p>
        <h2>4.lacks creativity</h2>
        <p>As already mentioned above – AIs are not built for creative pieces of work. So, it should be crystal clear by now that creativity or imagination is not the forte of the AIs. Although they can help you in designing and creating something special, they still can’t compete with the human brain. Their creativity is limited to the creative ability of the person who programs and commands them.

            Human brains are characterized by immense sensitivity and high emotional quotient. To put it simply, AIs can become skilled machines but they can never acquire the abilities of the human brain. The reason is that skills can be learned and mastered, but abilities come naturally and can only be honed.</p>
        <h2>5.Risk of unemployment</h2>
        <p>With rapid development being made in the field of AI, the question that plagues our intuitive brain is that – will AI replace humans? Honestly, I am not sure whether AIs will lead to higher unemployment or not. But AIs are likely to take over the majority of the repetitive tasks, which are largely binary in nature and involve minimum subjectivity.</p>
